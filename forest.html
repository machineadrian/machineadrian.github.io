        <h2>A WALK IN NATURE</h2>
<i>May 5 02024</i>
<p>What do I tell myself that hasn't been told by others? A simple boot on the ground, a simple snake in the grass, and simple thought in the mind, all beautiful creatures amongst their natural homes. And yet, me, the displaced, here, now. Would I feel better swimming in this lake? No, it's cold. I couldn't. Would I feel better in the sky? No. I haven't any wings, and I'd be cold. So logically, of course, I'm exactly where I'm meant to be. But a grumbling voice in my limbic system shakes my spine with declarations of inadequacy. "You," it points a bitter finger, "aren't welcome." And so I listen and I am shaken and I continue onward, of course, as you shouldn't take what others say too seriously. Imperfect dramatists prefer this explanation for their critics, that is, the hypocritical reversal: "What I've done was purposeful, except when it wasn't, what they've done was exceptional, except when it was purposeful." To allow another to have any real say in your life is to become wildly misdirected. It is at best to be chasing a setting sun, and at worst to be chasing a carrot on a stick. And I knew, through the squeaks of my aching feet, that if I were to be a vehicle, I must first be my own passenger.

With such abstract, lofty ambition comes a particularly unspeakable stress onto my youth. Fortunately, a simple walk clears the mind and induces a sense of divine. Chirping birds and flowing streams wrinkle symbols into my brain, tattooing reminders for the upcoming eternity. A leaf grew in dark pages of novelty, under moonlight all the same, while breathing panthresses ache in the same march toward nothingness. I walk on. I keep imagining ghosts hanging out around trees, punching each other at their funny jokes, keeping just out of my vision to scare me into thinking they're hiding. It was working. The animals, the spirit, and the earth, all swell and mend together in a cyclical fashion, and I walk forward, unknowing what for. "You ought desire not," I said to a browning leaf, "What has been desired for you." And so the leaf will die and so will I and all the possible culprits will be absolved, there shant be any courts nor forts to hide behind, so all is fine in heart and mind.

There is only illusory faith in the safety of a worn path. A bear doesn't care or stop to think as he throws you into the air. I hardly take my own advice, but if anything on the outskirts looks interesting, I atleast take due diligence to explore further in, snatching little flowers or acquiring little thorny cuts through my ankle socks. Hence my experiments with nature, buddhism, and global consciousness, and my corresponding injuries as well. On occasion the clandestine chemist fills his room with yellow smoke. It's rather unavoidable and it's a real nuisance to his roommates. Of course my own experiments are shrouded in this inversion; like the space within a vase, I can't exactly point to them, but I polish mirrors where its breath can blur our reflections. But when I see an empty Japanese room and when we see an empty American room we feel a particular difference. A bottle of Coca-Cola looks especially out of place in one of those rooms, which is it? Trick question: it's the American room, because the soda fits so kindly. I can never applaud a toxicity abroad, nor domestically. I don't want to be like those snobbish museum strollers, gazing at the trash can overflowing with banana peels and human filth, pretending to be enlightened and saying, "Oh! This isn't art? Oh my, oh myâ€¦" and on and on. No. Instead, at least for me. whenever possible it's more attractive to build contexts than content. Yes, what is more pliable and timeless than an incomplete, programmable, open-ended context? And what is more characteristic of such a pursuit than a simple walk through nature: nature that is defined by it's escaped definition, that nature that serves as the starting point for any philosophy after the fall of theology, my inquiry into my distinction or inclusion in it, nature aided by systems and complexity theory, nature that has it's anthropological, philosophical, ecological, biological, architectural, infinite -isms-ism's to it! The angel of Alexander Graham Bell flashes a sickly smile from heavy as he hears three teenage stoners ordering a 3 am pizza by his command over nature.

Even within our civilized timescale, which is but a fraction of the human timescale, which is but a fraction of our Earth's age, modern taxonomic systems for classifying plants and animals has begun recently. Researchers taking measurements of the Amazon Rainforest find a mind-boggling proportion of species they don't recognize. Charles Darwin's consequential work has shown even our naturalistic impulse for classification is a mere photograph of a forever-flowing waterfall, an idealistic Procrustean bed we have placed upon nature, a representative portrait following European tradition, that which is but a slice of time. Which is to say that surely the nature of nature is impossible to know; it's only aptitude is to change in some way necessarily immune to my imagination. The greatest leverage I've employed to understand this - that is, to understand, by some conceptions, God, - is by Steven Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science", a work whose victory surmounts to the glassblower's universal lens by which we might interpret complex data as having sprung from simple programs. But there's no need for all of this. It's a simple delight to walk through nature, isn't it?
