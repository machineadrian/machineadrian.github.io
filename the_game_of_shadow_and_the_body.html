        <h2>The Game of Shadow and the Body</h2>
      
<div><b>1.</b> Imagine a game of limited knowledge. </div>

<div><b>2. </b>The game is played between two players, where one player plays as the “Shadow” and the other as the “Body.” </div>

<div><b>3. </b>The player who is the “Body” begins by asking the “Shadow” a question. How the roles of the players are decided is irrelevant. The “Body” asks the “Shadow:” “Do you speak truthhood or falsities?” </div>

<div><b>4. </b>If the Shadow says they speak truth, then it must be true. </div>

<div><b>5. </b>If the Shadow says they speak false, then they cannot. Therefore, the Shadow will never say they speak false. </div>

<div><b>6. </b> Therefore, there exists one possible outcome to this game.  </div>
