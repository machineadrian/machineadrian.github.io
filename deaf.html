There was a time I first met the eyes of the moon, showered by the hues of sunset, and nursed the stumbling growths of a budding kinship. Within these images I saw the same thread of primordial passion I recognized within myself. I witnessed a certain connectivity combining the causal and the reclining. I noted these emotions, those unrelenting, that which is simultaneously so personal as to become innovative and so universal as to become unspeakably trite.

Thus, as we ponder the existence of a “sixth” sense, we must consider the “seeing” aspect, yes, the physical, the corneas, the light, the shapes and cones, but also, and arguably more importantly, the sightly aspects. That is, the experience both preceding and secondary to the initial contact. We lack half of the two-fold expression of this potential peripheral sensory experience. So, as these cognitions underline my both seeing and sight, I can conclude that a potential “sixth” may be accessed through an analysis of similar measure. Lacking the basal structure from which nuance ordinarily grows, I am left only with the symbolic, and therefore must take additional care of the abstract half. This means a recalibration, a focus on not fearing what resonates and taking care not to mistake the discordant for the harmonious. This is a reversal of the common fashion of life. Ordinarily, we experience, then we encrypt stimuli. But this is not true of the exploration of the internal unknown. Practicing a reversal of meaning is required. Allow me to illustrate.

 Could a blind man experience a sunset with the same fervor a seeing man could? No. However, the blind, armed with great compassion, could lead the abled to the greatest peaks, all the while bearing the whining of the cold and tired party members, taking them to where he was once taken before by hikers of appreciative eyes. The blind man, holding the party hand and hand, leads them toward the pink, setting, sun. The man, more attuned with his remaining senses, certainly his internal order, will know his experiment was a success not when he hears cries of great celebration, not at the clamor of unusual camaraderie, and certainly not at the sound of sighing relief of the aching moans of a burdened chair. The blind man will become sightly - not seeing - when he hears only a contemplative silence from his guests.
