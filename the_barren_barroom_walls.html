        <h2>The Barren Barroom Walls, or, The Mothden Mural</h2>
 <div>CHARACTERS OF THE PLAY:</div>
<div>The Barman<br>The Investigator</div>
<br>
<div>SCENE: Some saxophone-heavy jazz plays lazily through a stereophone in the corner. The bar is wrapped in an ugly wallpaper, full of past and future announcements at varying ages in the lifespan of paper ephemera. It forms a ugly, yellowing mural with varying levels of cheap filth and made-for-hire graphics. The Investigator is using a dull knife to peel rather unsuccessfully at the walls in search of something. He's rather intent. A sign reading: "THE MOTH DEN", the name of the bar, hangs crookedly above where hands can reach. A little light swings to the synchronous rhythm of breath , a pendulum obscuring and illuminating the rather nasty floor. The investigator is a sweaty, restless man wearing a trench coat with a briefcase to his side. The Barman is rather calm, polishing dishes for his empty, somewhat cramped bar. There is no one else inside.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: SPEAKING TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>The walls are covered in sure sign of retrograde,<br>
As former stains and posters, at sun's mercy, start to fade.<br>
And what they were were merely memories that once have passed,<br>
As water every two million years will have been gas.</div>
<br>
<div>Yet delight in dancer's faces in low light without erasure,<br>
Ensures the coming tape and glue of something new in nature;<br>
Well same same, or so-so, with only newish tints,<br>
Perhaps informed of light there shall be a cracking glint.</div>
<br>
<div>Well likely not, as light does not, travel far within,<br>
The windows, too, are boarded by a film of breath and gin.<br>
But I'll provide the razor if you're keen to scrape away,<br>
Just know there is no way beside the way a ways away.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR STOPS HIS FUTILE TASK, DROPS HIS DULL KNIFE TO HIS SIDE AND WALKS TOWARD THE BARMAN]</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: REPLYING TO THE BARMAN]</div>
<div>Then show me it up close, for your forays into the abstract,<br>
Do not calm the sobbing streets or bring me close to contact<br>
With an even ounce of evidence referring to our Eve,<br>
Indulge me: did you see her enter or her leave?</div>
<br>
<div>Did you see her dance or did you pour her any drink?<br>
By god! I implore you, stop your tasks and simply think.<br>
This sticky, inside air is like disease unto your head,<br>
As your widowed memories were surely once the freshly-wed.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>Silly man, I've told you: better luck in waterhole,<br>
To pick apart a drop from dust that water's swole.<br>
Wring me out in both directions and do all that you can do,<br>
My stay's obligatory; my shift will end at two.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: REPLYING TO THE BARMAN]</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: FUMBLING WITH HIS SUITCASE ON THE COUNTERTOP]</div>
<div>I'll turn my knuckles white pursuing petty pinch of dribble,<br>
My party's asking questions; they're unkind to common quibbles.<br>
Now tell me - a sloven spritz of mist shall quench my thirst -<br>
Recount the time you gazed upon the lady in the first.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: PRESENTS A PHOTOGRAPH FROM THE SUITCASE]</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: SETTING DOWN THE PHOTOGRAPH AFTER LOOKING AT IT]</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>What more can I say that I haven't already?<br>
Beautiful woman; of those there are plenty.<br>
Do you walk on beaches by moonlight in night,<br>
caressing the leeches, ensuring they're right?</div>
<br>
<div>No. To numerate scenes that I've seen,<br>
The vomit, the fighting, the distant obscene?<br>
The sweat or the hair, and the piss on the floor,<br>
The bloodiest ooze from beneath a closed door?</div>
<br>
<div>No; of coursen't, the course's been set,<br>
My conscience is dry so long glasses are wet.<br>
I set wetted sight onto moon far above,<br>
I set spotted specs my desk in search of</div>
<br>
<div>That everlasting: never flees like a flea,<br>
Bouncing 'tween hounds of what we oughtn't be.<br>
And so I polish thorough, with alcoholic admixture,<br>
Scrubbing at my lens for non-phenomenonic fixture,</div>
<br>
<div>The periodic pigeon has flown into my window,<br>
As it was open, I 'suppose so the wind blows,<br>
To cool off the sweat on the back of our necks,<br>
Of a guilty labor done only for checks.</div>
<br>
<div>But in my Inn, my stuffy cavern, birds can never stay;<br>
They provide the music freely but of course can never pay.<br>
Clandestine ornithology like singing for the mind,<br>
But destined just like Icarus for hymns of his design.</div>
<br>
<div>In holy books I spot some passing looks just like my life,<br>
Hardly mirrored in the sacred, lesser so upon the light,<br>
More in immolation, the evil flagellating man,<br>
As a fistful of moths are crushed within my hand.</div>
<br>
<div>But riddle me this, my dear Scotland Yard,<br>
As I'm but a man who'd rather not starve;<br>
If I ceased to pour, then I'd become poor,<br>
And surely some other'd open his doors?</div>
<br>
<div>The summer of insect's succinct in its ending,<br>
A funeral which'd be a petty method of spending,<br>
Both effort and currency, 'tis better to forget â€“</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: INTERRUPTING THE BARMAN]</div>
<div>No fool can wade in water without getting wet.</div>
<br>
<div>Are you a ticklish conductor,<br>
Orchestrating music of ship sinking under?<br>
Or are you the conductor of train of whose rails<br>
Have been laid such that only one man might prevail?</div>
<br>
<div>You're failing already in being concise,<br>
I beg and implore you, what happened that night?<br>
You speak of the bird, ought I to interpret,<br>
That that may have meant you have spotted our culprit?</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>Within my mind's eye, I've told not a lie.<br>
Externally seeking's to live and then die.<br>
The comfort you seek for the woman you've lost<br>
Cannot be sought in quantifiable cost.</div>
<br>
<div>But paradox, what's your worldiest wisdom,<br>
But architect's plan for erecting a prison?<br>
Your question: Do I recall one singular feature?<br>
The final answer: "No," with honesty of a preacher.</div>
<br>
<div>So worry not for facilities I haven't got,<br>
Again I'll repeat it: my memory's shot.<br>
What latent significance idle bestowed?<br>
For her being here, she'd be just a toad.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: REPLYING TO THE BARMAN]</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: GROWING UPSET AND IMPATIENT]</div>
<div>What maddening agony you've punished me with,<br>
What artisan way to suggest she's a bitch!<br>
I caution, tread careful with clevermost phrase<br>
Vocabulary's a log for leveraging rage.</div>
<br>
<div>The amputator ought fly with only one of two wings,<br>
'Twould only be fair in the cycle of things.<br>
As for me, honestly, I'm impartial she's missing:<br>
It's to the party's interests that I am submitting.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>Exactly which party is it you belong?</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: REPLYING TO THE BARMAN]</div>
<div>A party that dances to a far different song.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>The Hypocrite, always tactful in refutation<br>
Only when it suits him. As for her reputation<br>
I'm not convinced of your distance from her<br>
So tighten the gap so that we might confer.</div>
<br>
<div>And what of these "sobbing streets" that you have recounted?<br>
My ears only taste giggles whenever they're outed.</div>
<br>
        <div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: REPLYING TO THE BARMAN]</div>
<div>You've caught me. Call me a fool, never a liar,<br>
In morals and in ego, the latter's fire can inspire.<br>
I've plenty of fuel in the feud which we partake,<br>
The taste of which is still upon my tongue like venom's snake.</div>
<br>
<div>As for your ears, they just must be crusted to the brim,<br>
- Fitting for a man in occupation of his sin.<br>
So excuse my fancy footwork as I flee from questionnaire,<br>
As I'm meant to be the one loading up the snares!</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>En guarde. Call me a liar never a fool;<br>
But I've never heard a single song sung for this ghoul -<br>
I mean girl. Clearly, for all her grave glory,<br>
It's merely pocket lint to dispose of her story?</div>
<br>
<div>Or shall I go on, insulting common whore<br>
Alive of your indifference? But shan't it be a bore<br>
Of no significance to comment on the passing vermin?<br>
Yet you receive as if I've desecrated holy sermon.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR: REPLYING TO THE BARMAN]</div>
<div>What good it'd be to double down on what I know is fact?<br>
I am simply a scholar: untrained in how to act.<br>
It exceeds likelihood that in your philistinic ways,<br>
You've simply slipped the whispers through your mittens. Anyways!</div>
<br>
<div>Whatever! To name my party's only to refuge in superfluity<br>
In your arguments, less than half have got to do with me.<br>
And haven't you considered that the work shall be clandestine?<br>
For all your walking wit you lack an inch of wisdom stepped-in.</div>
<br>
<div>Now! We speak to much; sharpening wrong swords,<br>
I need a knife to peel the sticky papers off the boards.<br>
To your final question: indulge a lad in a little gift?<br>
Consider it a bridge to stroll across our little rift.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>Bof! - A decorum the way we're sanctified.<br>
A knife. Freshly sharpened from the other side.</div>
<br>
<div>[THE INVESTIGATOR TAKES IT GRATEFULLY]</div>
<br>
<div>[THE BARMAN: TO THE INVESTIGATOR]</div>
<div>Although the shreds you're searching surely lack a trace<br>
Of productivity to reunite you with your grace,<br>
I applaud your battle and your stamina in awe,<br>
Not every ordinary man can produce the gall</div>
<br>
<div>To peel the walls of away in fulfillment of his mission,<br>
Usually it's life that has us beat into submission.<br>
So I'll clap and bet myself that you'll somehow find<br>
The complete manifestation of your odd design.</div>
