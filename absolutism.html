        <h2>Absolutism</h2>
      <i>March 1 02024</i>
      <p>
I have pent up energy inside. It is idle, waiting to be released into something beautiful. I am the sea: pensive, thrashing, yet all the while timeless and unignorable. I realize formation only after a slow millenia, with each movement indistinguishable from the previous, each movement uniquely fixated on its predetermined goal. I am the destination of a worthwhile pilgrimage, and also the medium by which pilgrimage takes place. Men cross land to greet me. Then, with the air of the once-novel greetings still stiffening their lungs, they exhale, and announce their boredom. Nature is no polite guest: it announces itself wholly, but makes no attempts at petty mannerisms or formalities after your rejection. It makes no distinction between that rejection which was conscious or unconscious: the results are the same. And so the same men, drunk with emotion, cross me, too. They sail until shore, becoming immortal within this ephemera. Their usual facilities retire: eating, sleeping, and drinking become optional for the wandering soul.

Othertimes I am the sun: the simultaneous shelter for the cold and the architect of shade. I burn and I relieve; I heal and I harm. Plants stretch their stiff necks toward me like school children seeking advice, and like the humans, they are decent students but better practitioners; they take honest care in interpreting my poetic silence, though often I am in disagreement with their analysis. Such is the beauty of interpretation, that only after a long while, if at all, does true meaning reveal itself, like caked smoke clinging to photographs in the home. I enable sweet summertime,  remove your outer layers, and burn your naive skin on metal seats, and you curse at me for stabbing your back. But I forgive you, as with equal hate you are grateful to me that you can walk with your hands outside your pockets.

Often, in my most natural, comfortable state, I am like the sky. For man in his cramped quarters, liberating air turns to religion. Yet I incidentally force the same man’s retreat by my harsh breath. I lift a tree by its roots just to itch myself,  I lift a dog for pure amusement, all the while sharing the same joyous expression as an unborn child kicking his walls. Like with everything, the bored man gazes upon me and sees an imperfect, circus mirror. I contort and stretch, but the base is pure. I am a modifier, not a generator. For the man in the business of image-making - as all men are - the mirror is the final innovation; yet, even that finality is recursive.

I have been here all along, going about unnoticed like misery. I am like you; I am sure; we are the same. We each have our heart, and we each move about some unknown point, often intersecting, sometimes in quick succession, sometimes only once or twice, in spite of our windy, treacherous, timely paths. We have the same facilities, our self-definition, abstraction, ordinal containment, and infinitudes of potentiality. And yet as we gaze upon one another with solemn eyes, shoulders parallel, we see nothing but difference, or indifference, for the absolutism within us is never seen, for it is an action, or feeling, a soulbound aspect of being, immutable from ourselves, and impossible for perspective. But it doesn’t stop us from clamoring, hand in hand, head on shoulder, toward the nearest mountain (ourselves) to look atop it in brief moments of silence, breathing the same, really, yet distant, and far hungrier.
