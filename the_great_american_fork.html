        <h2>The Great American Fork</h2>
<div>I saw overgrown boys growing the worst mustaches while cradled upon the laps of shriveling women, passing a coughing vape between themselves as each plucked an occasional silver-white cat hair from her ripped black leggings;</div> <br>
<div>I saw three gray kittens stacked upon three corroded car batteries stacked upon a rather handsome leather gaming chair leaning on a lawn of dead grass, forming an unreadable text as if it were my own personal sky-scratching attempt at a modern Babel;</div> <br>
<div>I saw the casual appropriation of any spindle, plank, or hinge into incidental decor easily besting even the most imaginative works of Duchamp;</div> <br>
<div>I saw the memorization of the McDonald's Dollar Menu as Bodhisattvas memorize their Sutras, an equally political and religious rite of passage, then I saw the slow ship-of-Theseusian slip toward the Value Menu instead, the clandestine upheaval of the ancient tradition, an equal reminder that all is built upon breezy grains;</div> <br>
<div>I saw telepathy between men when gender ratios suddenly became even, each remembering the frivolity of the overhead light, the movie marathon they've been laboring to finish, and their collective history as horror fanatics;</div> <br>
<div>I saw shirts I'd lent to close friends appear on the back of strangers who I'd just met, and when I'd question them about what they're wearing they'd never hesitate to admit their ignorance of its origin;</div> <br>
<div>I saw frequently disembarking caravans with foggy dreams of Las Vegas or Wyoming, each always fueled with more dreams and spontaneity than fuel, then I saw them enjoy a decent but disappointing evening in Salt Lake City before returning home hungrier;</div> <br>
<div>I saw the mere rumor of a free 6-pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade or a spare pack of Marlboro Reds motivate groups of 4 or 5 to travel carless and penniless through 5 rural cities by means of pure willpower and cunning alone, then I saw the greatest innovations in political theory as the group of n+2 (they'd always have picked up two more on the way) decide by Greek neologism how to split the loot carcass, always egalitarian in a way that'd make Jesus Christ, Fredrich Engels, and Confucious smile crookedly from their respective clouds;</div> <br>
<div>I saw perhaps not a vegetable consumed in 6 months;</div> <br>
<div>I saw molly invite people to take turns sticking their heads and tongues out of moving car windows like thirsty beagles and shepherds, each bathing in the wind with their own personalities and expressions but with equally beatific ecstasy, receiving the occasional fly as a mere ante-price or sometimes as a direct revelation of from God, always at least with grateful indifference;</div> <br>
<div>I saw street-engineers please their ancestral god Vulcan by creating drug-motivated drug-machines but sometimes forgetting the schematics come morning time sobriety, sometimes inventing new machinery to explain the old night, repeating again night after night until they were left with a pile of only hypothetically functional wires, re-fashioned Fanta bottles, Scotch tape and buttons;</div> <br>
<div>I saw overly confident conductors offering rides in charming one-of-one vehicles painted in once-tacky, now sickly sun-rotted tones with exposed chains, hidden histories of little-brother's injuries, and obligatory piles of dust that'd never leave god forbid you were convinced to sit down in black jeans;</div> <br>
<div>I saw the near uniform taste of terrible German EDM music blasted by odd-looking gas station hat-wearing fellows vaping flavors like "Rainbow Sherbert" or "Mango Sunrise" from Optimus Prime mods, gassing me in the sticky backseat of their stuffy closed-window 2004 Hyundais, but quickly made amends with it as they were always a charitable sort and I was getting a free ride;</div> <br>
<div>I saw the most outwardly self-proclaimed radicals quickly bow and riddle off sensitive personal information of their friends at a sheriff's first request while everyone else was cool and they had just spent the evening repeating trite slogans;</div> <br>
<div>I saw childhood dinosaur bones exposed in the form of forgotten Adam Sandler films at the bottom of Wal-Mart 5 Dollar Movie archaeological excavation sites, then saw the memories quickly washed away as a macabre curiosity in Wal-Mart Brand Slime Business Box Kits filled its place;</div> <br>
<div>I saw some first-time smokers forget their most basic kindergarten sense of morality and for some reason eat literally all of the ice cream, but you could do nothing but forgive them through dry lips;</div> <br>
<div>I saw smelly merch worn by only-incidentally bearded men for Cartoon Network shows I thought I'd hallucinated offer literally everything they had, but becoming horrible crabs at the mere suggestion of taking some of their marijuana, even for money;</div> <br>
<div>I saw destitute, hodgepodge jalopies with randomly red bumpers fit with cologne selection, adjustable lumbar support and choice of various forms of gum, and I also saw evil sports cars on lease with annoying lights and personal Instagram accounts swimming with trophy boxes of Fillet-o-Fish, infantiley echoing the distant behavior of slain bear-tooth necklaces or wallets produced of enemies' scalps playing a bass-boosted SoundCloud Juice Wrld edit on broken speakers, where the driver cries out "Who Knew Evil Girls Had The Prettiest Face," while speeding recklessly, failing to catch the irony and reminding me the trite wisdom that reading a book by its cover is wrong, but you certainly ought judge the publisher by it;</div> <br>
<div>I saw violent encounters conclude with the departure of a still-bleeding man in a lopsided tri-colored Ross or Burlington bubble-coat on an electric scooter, permanently leaving the memory scarred not by the weeping violence but by hilarious getaway, the inverse emotion of the last minute of an anthropomorphic animal children's movie being filled with the the close-shot of a man's bleeding mouth being stomped repeatedly;</div> <br>
<div>I saw missionaries avert their gaze and cross the road at the sight of some, for certain souls aren't worth saving;</div> <br>
<div>I saw a girl's wandering hours spent in the hallucinatory halls of Wal-Mart, inspecting each mass-produced snowglobe and producing a singular fiction for each, with thoughts of spiritually counteracting the inherent poor Karma imbued into each mass-produced, caged snowman, or feeling every single shirt and inventing a new Dewey Decimal for systematic yet opinionated ranking based on material and aesthetics, all efforts for perhaps one to three people, all to be forgotten by tomorrow;</div> <br>
<div>I saw that a Tech Deck skateboard could enamor 16 people at once;</div> <br>
<div>I saw a smile form and heard little happy squeals when the pulled-over drunk driver realized it was their 21st birthday, and that maybe that accounted for something in the eyes of the law, and alas, for god-knows-why they were allowed to drive away untouched ;</div> <br>
<div>I saw symmetrical political shrines decorated with every-color-of-the-rainbow hats and shockingly custom framed images of Donald Trump in the only cobwebless corners of rooms otherwise dotted only by lumpy black Glad bags and suspiciously yellow-stained sheetless white mattresses;</div> <br>
<div>I saw a generous green-shirt-wearing man offer me a beer and a hit of some of his weed in intimate view of a CCTV while his elderly coworker slaved alone to unload a truckful of off-brand Pringles and shitty sodas after I'd snuck into the back box room of the same Dollar Tree where my former store and warehouse managers were both arrested and fired on the same day;</div> <br>
<div>I saw a day easily filled in attempted acquisition of some hygienic luxury like chapstick or facial lotion, pursuing dissipating scents to danker or damper locations and sketchier spots than explicable, realistic, or dreamable, with a success rate of about 50/50 but always rewarded with a story;</div> <br>
<div>I saw an unshakeable consistency in my safety in encounters with the police so long as there were white people present in my party;</div> <br>
<div>I saw that literally any object had its Hello Kitty counterpart like a contorted Aristotelian metaphysical form, and I saw that a de-collectivized worship service existed to praise the objects in this form, and that the membership was widespread enough for Believers to constantly be running into each other in my presence, swapping photographs and anecdotes of their Hello Kittyfied plates and chandeliers like Pokemon cards;</div> <br>
<div>I saw women with eating disorders speak in their coded jargon to each other and always be surprised at my code-breaking fluency, where sometimes they'd even suggest simply walking outside in the winter to shiver off some calories, but never expressed using any fully recognized English words;</div> <br>
<div>I saw three or four story houses with two or three sports cars parked outside for dropping off loser kids who spent the night relaying dodgy anecdotes of their harsh upbringing;</div> <br>
<div>I saw heaping piles of self-pity result in equal hills of luxury, but that the consistent self-construction of a losing avatar meant they'd inevitably squander it, and I saw radically self-responsible agents face petty forces of nature, and so long their spirit never completely drowned, on a long enough timeline they always sufficed;</div> <br>
